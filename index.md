title: About
---

I am a systems engineer and software developer with experience in the HR sector. Currently, I am part of a prominent Chilean company, where I am dedicated to developing software solutions that expand existing functionalities and improve the user experience.

I am deeply motivated that my work has a significant impact and contributes to improving people's relationships with technology.

Throughout my career, I have been an IT consultant, working directly with clients to understand their needs and provide customized solutions.

Likewise, I led software development teams to achieve the proposed objectives successfully and have been a mentor to professionals in training, specializing in technologies such as RoR.

This combination of experience has allowed me to develop a unique perspective and diverse skills to address technological challenges and lead projects effectively.
